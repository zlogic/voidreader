This project is a simple, quick&dirty application to download RSS feeds and send
them via SMTP or upload via IMAP to your mailbox. Your mailbox will provide an
interface to view feed and (optionally) view the source contents by downloading
the feed links and converting them into PDF attachments. PDF are ugly (most CSS
is ignored, Javascript is not supported), but allow to download items on a fast
unlimited connection for offline viewing later.
Can work as a simple and permanent replacement for Google Reader and works with 
all email clients, even on not-so-popular mobile operating systems.

Modify config.properties to suit your preferences, this file is
self-explanatory. Using the "file" handler is not recommended, it's not reliable
and should only be used to verify the downloader/PDF converter are working as 
intended.
Java 7 is required to launch the application. The "openjdk-7-jre-headless" works
well on standalone Ubuntu servers.
IMAP upload is the best method, since SMTP servers typically start blocking
emails after over ~100 messages are sent during a single session. IMAP also
allows to set an arbitrary sender address.
Typically RSS feeds return around 10-50 items.

Typically, the app should be run as a cron job.
To add the cron job, run:
1) Run "crontab -e" as the user the application will be added for
2) Paste "*/10 * * * * /home/user/voidreader/run.sh /home/user/voidreader/configuration"
   (assuming /home/user/voidreader/ is the path to the extracted application and
   /home/user/voidreader/configuration is the path to config.properties, the
   OPML and other configuration files.
   The "*/10" string means the script will run every 10 minutes.
3) Run "crontab -l" to confirm
